One of the most important factors lies in the count at the time of the pitch. This makes intuitive sense to any student of the game, and is perhaps seen most clearly in the inordinate size of the strike zone on 3-0 counts, which are often called in the pitchers favor.\nWhile we may wish that umpires were robots who were not influenced by count, score, situation or crowd, the fact that they are human and make slightly biased decisions is part of the romance of the game.\nThe fact that umpire ball/strike decisions can be quantified in such a way as to measure bias is an asset that can be developed in order to make better swing decisions as a batter. We will examine today some of the count influences on calls that may be useful to a batter. We will further discuss some ways these realizations can be used to improve a variety of models.\nIn order to test the question of how count affects umpire calls, I used data found from fangraphs.\nszcountfg\r## # A tibble: 12 x 5\r## Balls Strikes LHSZsize RHSZsize avgszsize\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 0 0 3.4 3.49 3.44\r## 2 0 1 2.75 2.89 2.82\r## 3 0 2 2.38 2.39 2.38\r## 4 1 0 3.43 3.52 3.48\r## 5 1 1 3 3.07 3.04\r## 6 1 2 2.53 2.43 2.48\r## 7 2 0 3.55 3.63 3.59\r## 8 2 1 3.1 3.21 3.16\r## 9 2 2 2.92 2.88 2.9 ## 10 3 0 3.7 3.73 3.72\r## 11 3 1 3.22 3.36 3.29\r## 12 3 2 2.87 2.97 2.92\rRight away, we see sizable differences in the strike zone depending on count. One thing that stands out is the enormity of the zone size on 3-0 counts. Not only are pitchers just trying to put the ball over the plate on 3-0, it seems the umpires generally lend a helping hand, granting borderline calls as strikes at much higher rates than in any other count.\nWe can better visualize this relationship by creating a linear model and visualizing this data with a scatterplot.\nlm_model \u0026lt;- linear_reg() %\u0026gt;%\rset_engine(\u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)\rfit_lm \u0026lt;- lm_model %\u0026gt;%\rfit(avgszsize ~ Balls + Strikes, data = szcountfg)\rtrainresults \u0026lt;- szcountfg %\u0026gt;%\rbind_cols(predict(fit_lm, szcountfg))\rmetrics(trainresults, truth = avgszsize, estimate = .pred)\r## # A tibble: 3 x 3\r## .metric .estimator .estimate\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 rmse standard 0.0746\r## 2 rsq standard 0.966 ## 3 mae standard 0.0576\r## # A tibble: 3 x 7\r## term estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 (Intercept) 3.32 0.0516 64.4 2.66e-13 3.20 3.44 ## 2 Balls 0.149 0.0222 6.71 8.71e- 5 0.0990 0.200\r## 3 Strikes -0.443 0.0305 -14.5 1.49e- 7 -0.511 -0.374\rOur model brings us impressive results on the limited data we have, which is a good sign, though somewhat unimportant with such a small data set. What we really want to see is what this looks like visually.\nLet’s take a look at the relationship between the number of strikes and the strike zone size in square feet.\nggplot() + geom_point(data=szcountfg, aes(x=Strikes, y=avgszsize)) + geom_smooth(data=szcountfg, aes(x=Strikes, y=avgszsize), method=\u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;, se=FALSE)\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\rAnd here are the number of balls in the count compared to the zone size.\nggplot() + geom_point(data=szcountfg, aes(x=Balls, y=avgszsize)) + geom_smooth(data=szcountfg, aes(x=Balls, y=avgszsize), method=\u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;, se=FALSE)\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\rHow might we explain this relationship? A couple things come to mind immediately. A likely possibility is that umpires want to let the outcome be settled on the field, without interfering themselves. This leads to a hesitancy to call a 3rd strike unless it is obvious, and likewise a hesitancy to call ball 4 unless it is obvious.\nWhether you view this as a good thing or a bad thing depends on which side of the decision you find yourself on, I suppose.\nThis relationship has also been observed in other sports using data, though perhaps none know this better than the fans who have watched officials refrain from calling pass interference on the final drive of the game, or basketball refs swallow the whistle on an obvious shooting foul in the final seconds.\nOne obvious application of this fact comes in adjusting models based on expected zone size for the count. For example, a batter may be rated higher in our models for laying off an 0-2 pitch compared to a 1-0 pitch in the same exact spot.\nI will likely look to implement this fact as I develop expected walk and strikeout percentages from last year’s MLB season. Using this information, we can design models which will help us identify players to expect bounceback seasons from, as well as find players we can expect to be overrated.\n","date":1644969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645037503,"objectID":"400d83bf454d4155e210af6b3be122e7","permalink":"https://collindougherty.github.io/thebaseballbreakdown/post/how-strike-zone-size-differs-based-on-count/","publishdate":"2022-02-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/how-strike-zone-size-differs-based-on-count/","section":"post","summary":"There are a variety of studies which have examined the way situational factors affect ball/strike calls.
